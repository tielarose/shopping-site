start at /

"Shop Now" button --> /melons

/melons
- can see all the melon 
- click on the details --> details page of specific melon (ex: crenshaw melon pic --> DEFAULT MELON DETAIL PAGE /cren, /alib)

/[melon_code]
the url changes by the melon, but the content is the same
- shows price
- "Add to cart" button (NEEDS TO BE IMPLEMENTED (flash message?))

TO FIX
- logo at top doesn't take you home
- my melon cart takes you the default cart
- checkout button ("checkout will be implemented in the future" flash message, takes you to the melons page)
- log in is empty link
